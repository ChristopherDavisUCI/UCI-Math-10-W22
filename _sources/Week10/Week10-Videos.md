An important piece of coding style that I've neglected to emphasize so far in Math 10.  If you find yourself copy-pasting some portion of code repeatedly, that is almost surely a sign that you should be using a different strategy.  Here we use the DRY principle to display 30 variants of the same Altair chart.

## Alternatives to Deepnote (5:00)

Deepnote has worked well in Math 10, but it's important to be aware of some of the more widely used alternatives, especially:
* [Jupyter notebook and Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/) which run on your computer.
* [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which, like Deepnote, runs in the cloud.
