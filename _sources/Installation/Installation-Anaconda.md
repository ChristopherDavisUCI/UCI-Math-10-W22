[Download link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Follow Anaconda's download and installation instructions.  The software is free, so if it mentions paying, you are in the wrong place.

I plan to use **Python 3.9**, which is the default Anaconda Navigator Python version as of December 14, 2021.  Probably any of Python 3.7-3.10 would be okay for Math 10.
