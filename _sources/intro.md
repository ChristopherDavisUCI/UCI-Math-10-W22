**Introduction to Programming for Data Science**

Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content. More material will be posted throughout the course.

**Course-level Learning Outcomes**

The goal of this course is to introduce programming in Python, with an emphasis on some of the tools that are most relevant to **data science**.  The primary learning outcomes for Math 10 are that students will be able to:
* select appropriate data types (both built-in Python types as well as types defined in external libraries) when performing computations;
* apply tools from unfamiliar Python libraries using some combination of documentation, error messages, and code examples written by experienced programmers;
* write code which is *Pythonic* (for example, avoiding unnecessary for loops) and adheres to the *DRY* (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle; 
* given an unfamiliar dataset, apply techniques of *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA) to gain a rapid first-impression of the dataset's contents;
* manipulate structured data using NumPy and pandas;
* produce interactive visualizations conveying significant aspects of datasets using Altair;
* illustrate the structure of a neural network and the various components involved in the training of a neural network, and implement the procedure using PyTorch;
* improve the performance of various machine learning algorithms by adjusting parameters within scikit-learn and PyTorch;
* recognize the potential for overfitting when applying a machine learning algorithm;
* create an educational, data-focused Jupyter notebook or Deepnote notebook using a combination of code cells and explanatory markdown cells.
