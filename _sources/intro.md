## Course-level Learning Outcomes

The goal of this course is to introduce programming in Python, with an emphasis on some of the tools that are most relevant to **data science**.  The primary learning outcomes for Math 10 are that students will be able to:
* select appropriate data types (both built-in Python types as well as types defined in external libraries) when performing computations;
* write code which is *Pythonic* and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle; 
* manipulate structured data using NumPy and pandas;
* display significant aspects of datasets using Altair;
* improve the performance of various machine learning algorithms by adjusting parameters within scikit-learn;
* illustrate the structure of a neural network and the various components involved in the training of a neural network, and implement the procedure using PyTorch;
* detect the presence of overfitting within a machine learning algorithm;
* apply tools from unfamiliar Python libraries using some combination of documentation, error messages, and code examples written by experienced programmers;
* create an educational, data-focused Jupyter notebook.
