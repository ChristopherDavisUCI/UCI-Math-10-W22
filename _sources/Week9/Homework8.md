# Homework 8

## Overview
Get started on the course project:

1.  Use the Project Template from Deepnote.
1.  Share the project on Deepnote with both Chris and Thurman.
1.  Find a dataset to use for the project and load it into the Deepnote notebook in the "Main portion of the project" section.  (This needs to be a dataset that was **not** already used in Math 10.)
1.  What aspect of this dataset are you planning to explore?  Describe this in the "Introduction" section.
1.  Perform some initial analysis of the dataset using scikit-learn or PyTorch (you don't need to use both, but you can if you want).  Put this in the "Main portion of the project" section.
1.  What are you considering for the "Extra" portion of the project?  State this in the "Questions to help Chris" section.
1.  Do you already know any References/Tutorials you are planning to use?  If so, list them in the "References" section.
1.  Use this exact same Deepnote project (not a duplicate of it) for your final project.  It's fine to make many changes later, such as using a different dataset, deleting material from this notebook, etc.
1.  For the submission, upload the ipynb file on Canvas.
