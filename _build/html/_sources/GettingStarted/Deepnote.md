# Deepnote

In Fall 2021, we used Jupyter notebooks.  In Winter 2022, partially because we are beginning with remote learning, we will use Deepnote notebooks.  Deepnote is a cloud-based resource for running Python notebooks.

Some advantages of using Deepnote instead of local Jupyter notebooks:
* Nothing to install.
* Most (if not all) Python libraries we need are already part of Deepnote.
* Easy to collaborate.
* Easy to upload datasets.

Some disadvantages:
* Less control over the environment.
* Because there are limited computing resources available to us, the performance may be less reliable at some times.
* Some functionality may be different between Deepnote and Jupyter notebooks.
