    "The DataFrame includes a \"date\" column, whose entries are strings.  Use each of the following methods to extract the month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) from the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If we wanted to get the year from a string like `s = '2000-01-01 08:00:00+00:00'`, we could use `s[0:4]`.  Adapt that strategy to get a pandas Series containing the month for each row, using `map` and a `lambda` function.  Convert the entries from strings to integers using `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Another option is to use `s.split(\"-\")`.  Use that strategy, again together with `map`, a `lambda` function, and `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  A more sophisticated option is to, as a first step, convert the `dtype` of the \"date\" column using `to_datetime`.  (In other words, replace what's in the \"date\" column so they are no longer strings; this doesn't require `map`.)  If `t` is one of the entries in the resulting column, then you can use `t.month` to get the month.  Again use `map` and a `lambda` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The best method is probably to avoid using `map` completely.  Convert the column again using `to_datetime`, and then adapt one of the methods from the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.html) to convert each entry in the series into a month number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Using that last method, create a new column in the in the DataFrame containing these months.  Name that column \"month\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything went correctly, the `dtype` of the \"date\" column should now be `datetime64[ns, UTC]`, and the `dtype` of the \"month\" column should be `int64`."
