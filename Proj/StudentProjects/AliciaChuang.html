<p><strong><em>Error Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>The mean aboslute error for the training data and the test data are relatively close, so there is no sign of overfitting of the data. While the absolute errors may seem large, because of the large step sizes, the relative errors are acceptable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>The number of owned users is positively correlated with the number of users rated by a factor of 0.69. As the number of people who own the game increases, the number of people who rate the game also increases, and as a general trend, if the game is published earlier, the percentage of the people who rate the game is higher than for the games published later.</p>

<p><strong><em>Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>The loss for the training data and the test data are both decreasing, so the neural network is working, and the training and test losses are very close, so there is no sign of overfitting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Section 3</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Goal: Visualize the data to put things into context</em></strong></p>
<p>Data Used: Year published (1600-2022) and owned users</p>

<p><strong><em>Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>Although there has only been 22 years in the 2000s so far, the number of boardgames published outnumber any of the other centuries by a significant amount. However, the average number of users for board games published in different years number roughly the same with 1700 being about 1/4 of the other centuries and 1900 about 1/2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project is split into 3 sections. The first analyzes the correlation between users owned, users rated, and the year published using regression. The second is a neural network that predicts the rating of a board game given six aspects of the game. The third gives a visualization of the dataset in terms of boardgames published and users owned in each century.</p>
