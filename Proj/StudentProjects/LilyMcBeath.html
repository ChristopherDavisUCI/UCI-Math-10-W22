<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am planning to explore various economic indicators in the Russian Federation from 2006 to 2020, and to what extent they correlate with one another. I am using data on economic factors from <a class="reference external" href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/russian-federation">The World Bank’s Data website</a>, cited below. I am also looking into whether any of these economic indicators correlate with the exchange rate between the Russian Ruble and US Dollar. This data may be interesting given the recent sharp fall in the value of the Ruble, following sanctions on Russia related to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a lot of missing data here, which I will address soon.</p>
<p>First I want to drop the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Country</span> <span class="pre">Name</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Country</span> <span class="pre">Code</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Unnamed:</span> <span class="pre">65</span></code> columns, which are the same for all factors, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Indicator</span> <span class="pre">Code</span></code>, as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Indicator</span> <span class="pre">Name</span></code> is more descriptive.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/all/series">World Bank’s Glossary</a>, the age dependency ratio is the ratio of those younger than 15 or older than 64 to the working-age population, and the rural population as a percentage of total population is found according to the data from the United Nations Population Division.</p>
<p>I will use the rural population as a percentage of total population as input, and the age dependency ratio as a percent of working-age population as output. Since these are both percentile values, rescaling is likely unnecessary.</p>

<p>It appears from this preliminary work that rural population is a somewhat good indicator of the age dependency ratio, in that as the rural population as a percent of total population increases, the age dependency ratio as a percent of working population decreases.</p>
<p>The next step will be to consider some other non-population-related indicators and compare with the Russian Ruble/US Dollar exchange rate. The Ruble to US Dollar historical spot rates were obtained from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/index.asp?first=yes&amp;SectionRequired=I&amp;HideNums=-1&amp;ExtraInfo=true">Bank of England’s Statistical Interactive Database</a>. We will reverse the order of the rows to sort by ascending years, and invert the average annual USD/RUB rates given to obtain the RUB/USD rates.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the rural population as a percent of total population in Russia (blue) seems to decline together with the RUB/USD rate (red), while the age dependency ratio as a percent of working population in Russia (orange) has been increasing since 2009.</p>
<p>What do the remaining indicators look like, in comparison to the Ruble / Dollar exchange rates?</p>
<p>Let us see if we can use some of these indicators to predict the Ruble to Dollar exchange rates. After looking into the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.albany.edu/~bd445/Economics_301_Intermediate_Macroeconomics_Slides_Spring_2014/Leading_Economic_Indicators_(Print).pdf">definitions of leading vs. lagging indicators</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.conference-board.org/data/bci/index.cfm?id=2160">top economic indicators for the U.S. economy</a> (acknowledging that these may not be optimal for an analysis of the Russian economy, but useful nonetheless for our purposes), I will try to predict the exchange rates using the following economic indicators, which include the rural population and age dependency metrics we looked at earlier, as well as others that are relevant to a nation’s economy:</p>

<p>We can see that there is a significant amount of variation in these indicators’ values over the 15 years. Also, notice that international tourism decreases sharply in 2020 (as expected).</p>
<p>We will use the years 2006-2016 as our training set and the years 2017-2020 as our test set, so that we can test the accuracy of our model on the data and be warned of possible overfitting. Since I want to use these specific rows for my training and test sets, I will use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iloc</span></code> to define them rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">train_test_split</span></code>.</p>
<p>First we will attempt to use Linear Regression, in hopes that the coefficients can give us some idea of how these indicators might be related to the exchange rate.</p>

<p>Above, we see indicators with relatively small coefficients in low opacity, negative coefficients (i.e. negative correlation according to the model) in red, and positive coefficients in green. We also see the highlighted maximum and minimum coefficients, representing the indicator with highest positive correlation and highest negative correlation, respectively, according to the model. It appears that net inflows of foreign direct investment as a percent of GDP may be an indicator of growth in the RUB/USD exchange rate, while inflation of consumer prices may be an indicator of decline in the RUB/USD exchange rate. This seems reasonable from an economic standpoint.</p>
<p>Now we will attempt to gage the accuracy of this model.</p>

<p>Notice that the test error is larger than the training error by over 6 orders of magnitude, which would suggest overfitting.</p>
<p>The test error from linear regression is about 25% of the average RUB/USD value in the test set.</p>
<p>Now we will try a different approach: K-Nearest Neighbors Regression.</p>

<p>It is clear that the linear regression method underestimates the RUB/USD exchange rates, while the K-Neighbors prediction is an overestimate.</p>
<p>Would a different value of K give a better model? We investigate using the method for plotting the train and test curves from the <a class="reference external" href="https://christopherdavisuci.github.io/UCI-Math-10-W22/Week6/Week6-Wednesday.html">course notes</a>.</p>

<p>It appears from the above graph that 1/K = 0.25 (so K = 4) may give a slightly better prediction than the original K = 3. We will avoid K = 1, despite the seemingly accurate results above, as this will result in overfitting.</p>
<p>As a final step, we will observe all of these predictions together along with the RUB/USD actual rates, from 2017 to 2020:</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although we had only a few years of data to work with, it was possible to gain some insights into the relationship between key economic indicators in Russia and the Ruble to U.S. Dollar exchange rates over the past 15 years. The linear regression model pointed to inflation and foreign investment as potentially significant economic indicators relating to the value of the Ruble. Additionally, predictions using linear regression and K-nearest neighbors regression appear to have some degree of usefulness, although this is limited.</p>
<p>There are a few potential areas where this analysis could be improved through further work. First, if more frequent data were available (quarterly, monthly, weekly, etc.), this would likely improve the accuracy of our models. Unfortunately such data did not appear to be readily available.</p>
<p>Additionally, the year 2020 presents a possible outlier in our data, considering how international tourism and other economic indicators were at uncharacteristic levels during this year. That being said, the year 2020 remains in this project for two reasons: the first being that removing it would constitute a 7% reduction in the number of data points, and the second being that a good model of RUB/USD exchange rates with regard to economic factors would ideally be able to accurately model the Ruble’s value even in times of crisis and uncertainty.</p>
